Shuffle modifies/improves your Media Library in a number of ways

== Description ==

 Shuffle modifies/improves your Media Library in a number of ways. Shuffle lets you:

1. Attach an item (Image, Audio, Video) to anything (Post, Page, Custom Post Type, another Attachment)!
1. Reorder an item's attachments using a simple Drag and Drop UI
1. Detach an attachment from an item without deleting the attachment
1. View all attachments attached to an item

All of these things should already be in WordPress... but they're not!

This plugin is especially useful if you are using WordPress as a CMS and/or have a media-heavy site.

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
